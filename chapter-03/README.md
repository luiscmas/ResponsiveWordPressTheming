[Wirefy](https://github.com/cjdsie/wirefy)
=================

Wirefy is a responsive wireframe boilerplate. 

The way designers design has changed thanks to "responsive web design" but we've continued to demonstrate wireframes in a static manner. 

To follow the trend of designing in the browser, Wirefy can be used as part of your user experience toolkit to present strategic plans through the use of functional components. 

Unlike many of the other boilerplates and frameworks, Wirefy doesn't focus on UI components, but stays focused on the things that matters.
