=== _s ===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called _s, or underscores, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

Some of the interesting things you'll find here include ...

*	A helpful 404 template.
*	A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of inc/custom-header.php to your header.php template.
*	Custom template tags in inc/template-tags that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication
*	Sample theme options in /inc/theme-options/ that can can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php
*	Some small tweaks in /inc/tweaks.php that can improve your theming experience. They can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php
*	Keyboard navigation for Image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-navigation.js and is enqueued from the image attachment template, image.php.
*	A script at js/small-menu.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in functions.php.
*	5 sample CSS layouts in layouts.
*	Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you quickly get your design off the ground.
*	The GPL license in license.txt. Make something cool.
